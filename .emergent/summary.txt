<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
Business Goal:
Build a production‑ready, AI‑driven on‑demand manufacturing website for Nivaas (Bengaluru) that serves as a lead‑generation and instant quoting platform, showcasing multi‑process manufacturing capabilities and a quality‑assured supplier network.

Initial Feature Requests:
- **Core Pages**: Homepage, Capabilities Hub, Quality/Compliance, Blog/Resource Center, Teamspace (Customer), Admin Dashboard.
- **Homepage**: Hero, Who we are section, Capabilities cards, Industries we serve badges with modals, and a high-volume manufacturing contact form.
- **Instant Quoting Engine**: A CAD upload module for instant pricing and DFM insights. Initially requested with AI, but later changed to a **mock service** to ensure data privacy.
- **Capabilities Pages**: Detailed, tabbed content for CNC Machining, Sheet Metals, 3D Printing, and Special Processes.
- **Content Population**: Scrape content ideas from  and  to create detailed, original content for all pages, including demo images and videos.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A comprehensive panel to manage:
    1.  Contact form submissions with a follow-up tracker.
    2.  A full CMS for adding/editing/previewing blog posts.
    3.  Lead-to-customer conversion and project tracking (multiple parts, multiple members).
    4.  Supplier assignment system (assigning whole projects or individual parts).
    5.  Supplier management and performance tracking.
    6.  A CRM-like feature for tracking lead status and meeting history.
- **Live Chat**: A live chat feature on the contact page that first collects user details.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application (FastAPI + React + MongoDB) has been built. It features a dark, futuristic theme. Several pages have been created and populated with detailed content and demo images, including Homepage, Industries, Quality & Compliance, and Contact. An Instant Quote feature is functional with a mock backend service. A placeholder admin dashboard exists, but it's not functional and doesn't display any data. The backend models and routes for the admin panel have been created but are not yet integrated with the frontend or the main server file.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The user provided a detailed breakdown of functionalities required for a comprehensive Admin Panel. The agent acknowledged this and was about to start the full implementation after several failed attempts to populate the existing placeholder admin page with data.
-   **Status**: NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Both. The backend testing agent should be used to verify all new API endpoints for the admin panel with seeded data. The frontend testing agent should be used to test the complete UI flow of the admin dashboard.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1**: Admin dashboard is not functional and shows no data. (Priority: P0)

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1**: The admin dashboard is just a placeholder and lacks the features requested by the user. The user has repeatedly stated that they see no data or functionality.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent created , , and . However, the routes were never integrated into , the seed data script was not executed correctly, and no frontend components were built to display the data or provide the requested functionality.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  **Backend**:
            -   Integrate the admin routes from  into .
            -   Create an endpoint to execute the seeding script from  or run it directly.
            -   Restart the backend server and verify the new admin API endpoints work correctly using .
        2.  **Frontend**:
            -   Overhaul  completely.
            -   Build a tabbed interface for each requested admin function (Contacts, Blogs, Projects, Suppliers, etc.).
            -   Create components to fetch and display data from the new admin API endpoints.
            -   Implement the full CRUD functionality for each section as requested.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a core requirement for the client (Nivaas) to manage their business operations, from lead management to project and supplier tracking.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1**: Build the complete Admin Panel system. (Priority: P0)

**Task Detail**:
-   **Task 1**: Implement the comprehensive admin dashboard based on the user's detailed 6-point functional specification.
    -   **Where to resume**: Start by integrating the backend admin routes into . Then, completely rebuild the  page to include all required UI components, data tables, forms, and state management for the specified features.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: A fully functional admin dashboard for managing leads, blogs, customers, projects, and suppliers.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    -   **P1**: Enhance remaining Capability pages (, ) with detailed content and images, similar to .
    -   **P1**: Implement a detailed blog post page. When a user clicks Read More on the blog listing, they should be taken to a new route () displaying the full article with images. The component  exists but needs to be fleshed out and connected.
    -   **P2**: Implement the backend logic for the live chat feature on the contact page. The UI has been created, but it needs to connect to a backend service for admins to receive and respond to messages.
-   **Future Tasks**:
    -   Implement the Teamspace customer workspace with role-based access and data tables.
    -   Integrate a real email service (e.g., SMTP) for sending admin notifications, as requested initially.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend**: FastAPI
-   **Frontend**: React
-   **Database**: MongoDB (including GridFS for file storage)
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components
-   **State Management**: React Context API ()

**key DB schema**
-   : Defines schemas for User, Quote, Order, BlogPost, ContactSubmission, etc.
-   : Defines new schemas for Supplier, Project, Part, FollowUp, Lead. These are not yet integrated into the live database.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Main backend file. Needs to be updated to include admin routes.
-   : Contains the new, unintegrated API endpoints for the admin panel.
-   : Contains the demo data for the admin panel. Needs to be executed.
-   : The frontend page for the admin dashboard. Needs a complete rewrite.
-   : Main router for the frontend application.
-   : The main navigation header. Updated to show an admin link.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The content is sometimes hardcoded in JSX files () and sometimes loaded from a Python file () via API. This should be standardized, preferably by having all dynamic page content fetched from the backend.
-   The agent created  and then renamed the old file. It would be cleaner to directly edit the target file () to avoid confusion and duplicate files.

**key api endpoints**
-   
-   
-   
-   (New/Unintegrated) 

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **NO AI/LLM**: The user was very explicit about data privacy. The CAD analysis and quoting engine must remain a **mock service**. Do not introduce any AI features or send customer data to external services.
-   **Admin Panel is Priority #1**: The user's most recent and repeated requests are all focused on building the comprehensive admin dashboard. This should be the immediate focus.
-   **Use Demo Data**: The admin panel needs to be populated with the demo data defined in  to be testable.
-   **Content-Rich Pages**: The user expects all pages to be populated with detailed, professional content and images, similar to the  and  pages that have already been completed.

**documents created in this job**
-   None.
